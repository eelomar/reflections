What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The default folder .git is created and the configurations

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the changes before the commit. File can be in the working directory but not in the staging area. Then when a commit is don just the files in the staging area are added to the repository
The value is to make logical commits instead of commit per each file.
