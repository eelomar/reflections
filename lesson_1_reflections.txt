Because is easier come bac to file taht worked

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
    
Yes, when the code is too small or easy is not really neccesary, but when the code estart to be large or you work in a team is much better have a version control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because like taht you can upload version completeli functional, for example you change th HTML and also the CSS at time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
DF oldFile newFile

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    
Because you always can come back to an older and functional version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
